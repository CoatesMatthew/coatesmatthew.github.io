* **Keynes, Wittgenstein, and Probability in the Tractatus**
  * It has been questioned why Wittgenstein wrote a significant amount on probability in the Tractatus. In this paper I answer this question. I claim that the primary aim of Wittgenstein's account was to criticize a Keynesian theory of probability and provide multiple pieces of evidence to demonstrate this. This then provides an answer to the question of why Wittgenstein wrote such a significant amount on probability. He wrote it because it was salient at the time. Whilst Wittgenstein was at Cambridge there was significant discussion of probability by his philosophical interlocutors, particularly Keynes but also Russell, Moore and others. Wittgenstein thought he had the answers to the problems that were being discussed and set them out in the Tractatus.

* **Modelling of climatic tolerances of three earthworm species; Satchellius mammalis, Lumbricus friendi and Lumbricus festivus using Maximum Entropy Modeling**
  * Opuscula Zoologica, 2022
  * With Emma Sherlock and Csaba Csuzdi
  * Earthworm distributions are poorly known and individual species climatic tolerances, even less so. This paper sets out to use three species with a mainly Anglo-French distribution to test out whether using Maximum Entropy Modelling (Maxent) could be useful when studying earthworm distributions. It also gives an indication of how the likely climatic changes over a 50 year period will affect them. Overall the software seems to give useful information of where across Europe a particular species will thrive, even if not currently recorded there. It gives a real insight into how particular species might be better able to survive longer drier periods than others and which are on the edge of their climatic range already. Maxent modelling was clearly successful in demonstrating that the distributions of the ecologically different earthworm species are affected by a combination of different environmental variables. In the case of the epigeic Satchellius mammalis they are the annual temperature range, the precipitation of the driest month and the mean annual precipitation, for the epi-endogeic Lumbricus festivus they are the precipitation of the driest month, the precipitation of the wettest month and the annual temperature range. For the anecic Lumbricus friendi the most important environmental variables proved to be the annual temperature range, the mean diurnal temperature range and the precipitation seasonality.
