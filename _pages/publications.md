* Keynes, Wittgenstein, and Probability in the Tractatus
  * It has been questioned why Wittgenstein wrote a significant amount on probability in the Tractatus. In this paper I answer this question. I claim that the primary aim of Wittgenstein's account was to criticize a Keynesian theory of probability and provide multiple pieces of evidence to demonstrate this. This then provides an answer to the question of why Wittgenstein wrote such a significant amount on probability. He wrote it because it was salient at the time. Whilst Wittgenstein was at Cambridge there was significant discussion of probability by his philosophical interlocutors, particularly Keynes but also Russell, Moore and others. Wittgenstein thought he had the answers to the problems that were being discussed and set them out in the Tractatus.
